# beastr

**B**etter **E**nvironment/**A**nimal **S**ensor **T**elemetry **R**epository

"Better" as in "better than nothing". There are many other solutions that are more
developed than this, most notably [Movebank](https://www.movebank.org/)

The goal of beastr is to provide a framework for storing, accessing, and processing
wildlife telemetry data. 

## Installation

You can install the package using the [devtools](https://devtools.r-lib.org/) package

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github('rgzn/beastr')
```

## Example

Build your database:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(beastr)
library(sf)

# Use example source data
fix_file = system.file("inst/lotek/33452.txt", package = "beastr")
device_file = system.file("inst/deployment/devices.csv", package = "beastr")
animal_file = system.file("inst/deployment/animals.csv", package = "beastr")
deploy_file = system.file("inst/deployment/deployments.csv", package = "beastr")
myDB = paste0(tempdir(check = TRUE), "/", "example.gpkg")

# Build a database
build_database(fix_files = fix_file,
               device_files = device_file,
               animal_files = animal_file,
               deployment_files = deploy_file,
               dsn = myDB,
               tz = "US/Pacific")

# What layers are in there?
sf::st_layers(myDB)
```

View data linked to animals, rather than sensors:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

points = sf::st_read(myDB, layer = "animal_fixes")

points %>% 
  ggplot2::ggplot() + 
  ggplot2::geom_sf(ggplot2::aes(fill = animal_id))

```

  - integrate with movebank (export/import)
  - add new readers as new devices are used
