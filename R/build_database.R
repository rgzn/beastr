# build_database.R
#
# reads input data and creates a spatial database




#' Construct geopackage sqlite database from scratch
#' This takes input files describing animals, devices,
#' deployments, and the data files, and constructs a geopackage
#' @param fix_files A path, or paths, to files with telemetry fixes.
#' @param device_files A path, or paths, to CSV files containing information
#' about the telemetry devices used. This must include an `ID` column.
#' @param animal_files A path, or paths, to CSV files containing information
#' about the animals on which devices were deployed. This must include an `ID`
#' column.
#' @param deployment_files A path, or paths, to CSV files specifying which
#' devices were deployed on which animals and when. Columns must include:
#' `AnimalID`, `DeviceID`, `In_Service`, and `Out_Service`.
#' @param dsn The path to the database file to be created. Currently must be
#' a .gpkg file.
#' @param delete_dsn If TRUE, remove existing dsn.
#' @param locale Specify time zone using locale object. See [readr::locale()]
#' @param tz Specify time zone using known character string. ie "US/Pacific"
#' @return [build_database()] returns `TRUE`, invisibly.
